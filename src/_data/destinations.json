The tayalet, or boardwalk, is full of people running, scootering, playing music, and just enjoying themselves and the water is beautiful and great for swimming. I’ve been lucky enough to spend seven trips in Tel Aviv (most of them organized tours, plus a summer spent living there), and I’m *hopefully* returning in January."

We were both abroad in Madrid and flew in for Spring Break. After spending a few nights with family and friends in other parts of Israel, we headed to Tel Aviv and had the absolute best time. Some highlights included shopping at Shuk Hacarmel (a big outdoor market near the beach with food and souvenirs), eating shakshuka (my favorite Israeli food!), relaxing on the beach for nearly four hours and picnicking on a big lawn overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. We kept saying that we felt like we’d opened a bottle and poured out a day of summer. Perfect doesn’t begin to cover it."

We initially planned to use a GetYourGuide tour, but by the time we went to buy tickets, the tour had sold out. We ended up renting a car and following a similar itinerary. We visited a coffee plantation, a waterfall and La Fortuna (which had a volcano). We also did lots of activities like hiking and birdwatching. We saw incredible wildlife, including snakes and sloths.

Tokyo's subway system is quite organized, with every stop labeled, which made getting around easy. I stayed in the Shinjuku area, where I did some shopping at places like Uniqlo. I also visited the Tokyo Dome, which has roller coasters and other attractions. I made sure to see the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Sky Tree, where you can even catch a glimpse of Mount Fuji on a clear day. I also visited an art museum with a Sky Deck and explored some beautiful shrines. I went to a unique art installation called TeamLab Tokyo, which was quite an immersive experience.
