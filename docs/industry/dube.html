        <h1>Packing tips from a pro: Aviation writer Rachel Dube is “addicted” to travel</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Rachel Dube has been a travel writer since 2021, with features in AFAR, Insider, Teen Vogue and more. She’s been traveling her whole life but especially connected to international exploration when she visited Italy just as the country began to re-open after COVID-19.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“Since then, I’ve been addicted,” Dube said.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Dube said she doesn’t have one favorite trip, but she loved her first visit to Japan. She woke up at sunrise to see Mount Fuji from her bedroom window and said she’ll never forget the experience.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“It was incredible,” Dube said. “The culture was so unique and every city has such a different vibe. It was so easy to just get lost there, and it reminded me why I love travel so much.”</p>

  

  
    
<p>When planning for a trip, Dube said she researches extensively. She reads articles, checks social media and asks friends for recommendations. All her findings go in a Google Doc with lists of activities, restaurants, hotels and events. From there, she narrows down her favorite picks and uses an app like Wanterlog to sort everything out and create an itinerary.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“I think nowadays with the travel boom it’s so important to book things in advance and be organized,” Dube said.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Dube said she doesn’t see herself stopping traveling anytime soon.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“Travel is important because it gives you the opportunity to experience new cultures, step out of your comfort zone and see the world,” Dube said. “It’s one of my favorite things to do and honestly, the more I see, the more I crave it.”</p>

  

  
    
<h2>Dube’s Efficient Packing Tips</h2>

  

  
    
<ul>
  
  <li>Use an Away bigger carry-on. It’s expandable, holds SO much, and can fit into the overhead bins on most aircraft.</li>
  
  <li>Invest in packing cubes. In addition, make sure you plan out your outfits in advance. I like to take photos so I know exactly what I’m going to wear and how I would style it. Since it’s all organized, it’s easy to get myself dressed and sleep a little extra when I’m on a trip.</li>
  
  <li>Baggage gets lost during those tight connections so it’s best to try to be minimalistic during spontaneous weekend trips.</li>
  
  <li>Travel as much as you can while in college. Once you start working, it’s not as easy.</li>
  
</ul>
