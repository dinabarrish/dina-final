        <h1>Meet Zach Griff, the Av Geek who travels the world for The Points Guy</h1>
        

  
    
<p>At age 10, Zach Griff received a Microsoft Flight Simulator from his aunt. He played the game every day and soon became obsessed with all things aviation.</p>

  

  
    
<p>"I got hooked," Griff, now a senior reporter for <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/about/">The Points Guy,</a> said. "I was fascinated by the concept of travel, especially from the airline's perspective, and how amazing airplanes were."</p>

  

  
    
<p>Working as an aviation writer for the past six years, Griff has been to 63 countries. While he said he loves exploring new destinations and cultures, his favorite part of travel gets down to basics: the plane. Griff is a self-proclaimed “Av Geek” with a world of travel experience and advice.</p>

  

  
    
<p>"I love the entire flying experience, from the cabin comfort to the views outside the window," Griff said. “I’m not the type to spend all day at the airport taking pictures of planes, but I’m most definitely an Av Geek.”</p>

  

  
    
<p>After following The Points Guy on Instagram for “forever,” Griff stumbled upon a job posting and, to his surprise, landed the reporting gig.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“I never thought I could work in an industry I’m super passionate about,” Griff said. “It's been the coolest thing I could possibly do, and I can’t imagine doing anything else at this point.”</p>

  

  
    
<p>In 2019, Griff took what was then the World’s Longest Flight: United Airline’s 19.5 hour route from Newark, New Jersey, to Singapore. He said he spent the entire time marveling at the concept of crossing multiple continents in less than a day and arriving on the other side of the world.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“It was an incredible journey,” Griff said. “One of my favorites, for sure. So much uninterrupted flight time.”</p>

  

  
    
<p>During COVID-19, United rerouted that same flight to John F. Kennedy Airport in New York, adding three miles and establishing a new record for World’s Longest Flight.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“I knew that once they announced it, I had to do it,” Griff said. “The experience could not have been cooler. I even got to see the Northern Lights out the window.”</p>

  

  
    
<p>Griff said he loves traveling with his wife, who isn’t an Av Geek, even though she’s always laughing at his excitement onboard.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“She just wants to get to the destination,” Griff said. “I just want to fly.”</p>

  

  
    
<p>Staying up-to-date with the ever-evolving travel industry is his main challenge as an aviation reporter, Griff said.</p>

  

  
    
<p>"There's always something happening," Griff said. "Airlines open new lounges and make updates, and I want to cover it all."</p>

  

  
    
<p>When Griff gets caught up tracking route statistics, best deals on airline credit cards and tourism’s impact on global economies, he said he often reminds himself that above all, travel creates reunion and joy.</p>

  

  
    
<p>“Airlines, airplanes, aviation bring people together,” Griff said. “I think travel makes the world a happier place.”</p>
