        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <h4>Dina Barrish, senior journalism major at The University of Texas at Austin.</h4>
        <p>During my semester abroad in Madrid, Spain, I caught a serious case of the Travel Bug. Every weekend became a new episode of “Where in the World is Dina?” I constantly explored different destinations, from Ibiza, to Morocco to Vienna. By the time I flew home, I’d tracked 13 autonomous communities (like states in the U.S.) in Spain and 10 countries. I became obsessed with the thrill of boarding a plane and waking up somewhere completely new. I became obsessed with adventure.</p>
        <p>That summer, I had the opportunity to intern with United Airlines and travel standby to anywhere in the world free of charge. The bug had bitten me hard, and I was determined to see and do it all. Weekend after weekend, armed with a bright blue backpack and a “let’s wing it” (ha, ha) attitude, I showed up at the airport to board any flight with an open seat. There was the time I meant to go to Amsterdam and ended up in Tel Aviv, the time I watched the gate doors close for Phoenix and sprinted through the terminals to L.A. and the time I, against all odds, snagged the very last spot to Iceland.</p>
        <p>Vetting hostels, navigating public transportation systems, staying safe in new cities and exploring excursions and nightlife spots was definitely part of the adventure, but could have been much easier with some insider knowledge. That's why I decided to create a one-stop resource for college students who, like me, want to travel the world without breaking the bank or stressing to excess.</p>
        <p>Introducing ... Postcards: The travel hub by college students, for college students.</p>
        <p>On the “Destinations” page, you’ll find a list of 10 different international locations. Click on the links to explore a college student’s experience traveling there, as well as public transportation, hostel, restaurants, nightlife, excursions and safety recommendations. There’s also an “Industry Insights” page with feature stories and tips from aviation professionals.</p>
        <p>Happy adventuring!</p>
