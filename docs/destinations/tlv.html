        <h1>Explore Tel Aviv</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Tel Aviv has the best beaches in the world. Not that I’ve been everywhere in the world, but somehow I’m confident in this. The tayalet, or boardwalk, is full of people running, scootering, playing music, and just enjoying themselves and the water is beautiful and great for swimming. I’ve been lucky enough to spend seven trips in Tel Aviv (most of them organized tours, plus a summer spent living there), and I’m *hopefully* returning in January.</p>

  

  
    
<p>This past April was a special Tel Aviv trip for me and my best friend Rikki – our first time planning the entire itinerary ourselves. We were both abroad in Madrid and flew in for Spring Break. After spending a few nights with family and friends in other parts of Israel, we headed to Tel Aviv and had the absolute best time. Some highlights included shopping at Shuk Hacarmel (a big outdoor market near the beach with food and souvenirs), eating shakshuka (my favorite Israeli food!), relaxing on the beach for nearly four hours and picnicking on a big lawn overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. We kept saying that we felt like we’d opened a bottle and poured out a day of summer. Perfect doesn’t begin to cover it.</p>

  

  
    
<p>My strongest recommendation is to remember sunscreen! Rikki and I ended up so sunburnt, and it took weeks and bottles of aloe to relieve the burns. But it was more than worth it. I can’t wait to return to this amazing city and country.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>Falafel Hakosem: Israelis drive from all over to eat at this legendary falafel and shawarma restaurant in the heart of Tel Aviv. Prepare for long lines, but it’s worth it: many crown Hakosem the best falafel in the country.</li>
