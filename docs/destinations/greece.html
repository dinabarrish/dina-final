        <h1>Explore Greece</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Joey Harris graduated last spring from Wooster College in Ohio. I spoke with him about his post-graduation backpacking trip with his friends, which kicked off in Greece. Joey had great insights about cultural differences and fun activities in Greece.</p>

  

  
    
Can you share the backstory of your trip to Greece and the rest of Europe?

  

  
    
Absolutely! I had been planning this European adventure for a while. I was set to spend about three weeks there, so I packed as many clothes as I could into my bags, thinking I wouldn&#39;t have many chances to do laundry. Little did I know, there were plenty of places to wash clothes. I met up with my friends, who are twins, in Greece. Their family was there for a week, renewing their vows, and then we set off for a backpacking journey across Europe.

  

  
    
Tell us about your time in Greece. Any standout experiences or places you visited?

  

  
    
Greece was incredible. We started in Loutraki, a beautiful beach town, and we spent a lot of time in the sun. We explored Athens and Corinth, tried a ton of Greek food (Tzatziki was a standout), and marveled at the beaches. Greece really set the tone for our adventure.

  

  
    
Can you share any memorable or funny moments from your time in Greece?

  

  
    
Oh, there were so many funny moments! One that sticks out is me constantly saying, &quot;Who knew Greek life was so big out here?&quot; I found it hilarious, and my friends got a kick out of it, too.

  

  
    
What were some cultural surprises or differences you encountered, especially related to food and daily life?

  

  
    
Two things that stood out were the cost of using bathrooms and the absence of American-style coffee.

  

  
    
Any travel tips for someone planning a similar journey?

  

  
    
Turn off your phone, bring a digital camera and embrace the limited cell service. Immersing yourself fully is one of the best things about the experience. And cliché as it may sound, make the most of every moment. It’s truly an awesome experience.

  

  
    
What was the most unforgettable part of your trip?

  

  
    
Seeing iconic sites that I&#39;d only heard of or seen in pictures was surreal. The only downside was saying goodbye to my friends as we went our separate ways for the last few days.

  

  
    
Would you go back to Greece?

  

  
    
Definitely! And there are also so many other cities and countries I want to explore.
