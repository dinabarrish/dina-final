        <h1>Explore Tokyo</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Fletcher Block is a junior sociology major at Princeton University. He interned with me at United Airlines. I chatted with Fletcher about his five-day, spontaneous, solo trip to Tokyo, Japan. He has great insights about efficiency, cost and overall fun in the city!</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you choose Tokyo as your travel destination?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: Tokyo was a place that I thought would be really cool to visit. Plus, I had the advantage of having free standby flights from my internship at United Airlines. So, I found an available spot to Tokyo and decided to hop on the flight.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you pack?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: I packed everything in a carry-on bag for the five days I was there. Looking back, I wish I had left a little more room in my bag because clothes were cheaper in Japan, and there was a lot of shopping to do. But it worked out, although it was the tightest packing I've ever done.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Can you give us a detailed walkthrough of your trip, starting from when you landed in Tokyo?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: Absolutely! When I first arrived, I didn't do much research beforehand, but I had booked an Airbnb in advance. I navigated the airport and eventually got a Suica card to pay for the trains. Throughout my trip, I used Apple Maps and Google Maps to navigate the subway system, which was incredibly convenient. Tokyo's subway system is quite organized, with every stop labeled, which made getting around easy. I stayed in the Shinjuku area, where I did some shopping at places like Uniqlo. I also visited the Tokyo Dome, which has roller coasters and other attractions. I made sure to see the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Sky Tree, where you can even catch a glimpse of Mount Fuji on a clear day. I also visited an art museum with a Sky Deck and explored some beautiful shrines. I went to a unique art installation called TeamLab Tokyo, which was quite an immersive experience. I wrapped up my trip with a visit to Disney Sea, a theme park near the airport.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: That's impressive! Did you encounter any interesting or surprising moments during your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: One interesting thing was how everyone in Tokyo followed societal rules very strictly. For example, they don't run onto the subway, and this is emphasized with signs and announcements. In the U.S., we tend to bend the rules more.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What were some of the highlights of your trip? What stood out the most?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: It's challenging to pick just one thing, but what really stood out was how different everything was in Tokyo—the city, the language and the overall culture. It was an incredible experience to immerse myself in a completely different environment.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Can you tell us about the best food you had and where you enjoyed it?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: Oh, wow. I had some fantastic meals during my trip. One memorable meal was broiled eel over rice on my first night in Tokyo. I also had some great dumplings and Korean fried chicken in the Shinjuku area. And, of course, the fluffy pancakes in Ginza were amazing.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What did nightlife look like on your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: I went out one night with a friend in Shibuya, known for its famous pedestrian crossing. It was an interesting experience, but we found ourselves to be some of the tallest people there, which was amusing. I’m 5’10”.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you feel about solo travel versus being with friends during your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: I enjoyed both aspects of the trip. Traveling with friends is great because you have companionship, but I also learned to appreciate solo travel during this trip. It gives you more flexibility and the opportunity to explore on your terms.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Based on your experience, what advice would you give to college students who are eager to explore Tokyo?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: My advice would be to plan your trip in advance, especially if you have limited time. Tokyo has so much to offer, and having a rough itinerary can help you make the most of your visit.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Would you go back to Tokyo?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: For sure. There's still so much more to explore, like Kyoto and Mount Fuji. It would also be exciting to experience Tokyo during different seasons, such as skiing in the winter.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Finally, for college students on a budget, how did the overall cost of your trip compare to your expectations?</p>

  

  
    
<p>FLETCHER: Tokyo can be expensive to get to, but once you're there, you can manage your expenses. My Airbnb cost $350 for four nights, which wasn't too bad considering the location. So, while the initial flight might be pricey, you can find ways to make the most of your budget once you're in Tokyo.</p>
