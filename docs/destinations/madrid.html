        <h1>Explore Madrid</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Full disclosure: I’m highly biased about this city. Madrid has everything – nature, museums, culture, food and tons of excitement. For someone like me who loves being in the center of the action, It was the ideal study abroad city. Because I stayed in Madrid for much longer than a weekend, I’m going to describe a few of my favorite spots.</p>

  

  
    
<p>First, Parque Retiro – a huge park with a Crystal Palace, peacock garden, rose garden, sculpture garden, boats on the water and so much more. I loved coming to Retiro to read, chat with friends and just walk around. It’s so beautiful and such an easy metro stop, especially from line two.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Casa De Campo is also lovely to walk through and much less touristy than Retiro. You’ll eventually reach a small lake surrounded by restaurants and coffee stands, and you can rent boats here just like at Retiro. I enjoyed long runs and semester reflections with friends at the Casa De Campo lake.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Malasaña district is the best area for college students (I did live there, so this is again my biased opinion). It offers a wide variety of bars, coffee shops and thrift stores, all within walking distance from nearby universities. Ojalá, a beach-themed bar with a floor of sand, and Federal Cafe, a must-go spot for coffee, brunch, and study dates, are just two daily Malasaña highlights.</p>

  

  
    
<p>If you’re lucky enough to visit Madrid on the second weekend of the month, check out Mercado de Motores: an indoor/outdoor market in an abandoned train station. Local jewelers and artists sell their work at affordable prices, and the options are less picked-over than at the popular Sunday market, El Rastro.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Eat as many patatas bravas as you can, order a tinto de verano (or two or three) and dance all night in this vibrant capital city.</p>
