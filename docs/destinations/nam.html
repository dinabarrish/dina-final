        <h1>Explore Vietnam</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Grace McCarthy is a seasoned traveler. When she studied abroad in Sevilla, Spain, she traveled solo for three weeks, in addition to many other trips she’s taken. She graduated Western Washington University in 2020 and now works as the editor for The Northern Light newspaper in Blaine, Washington. In October 2022, she stumbled upon cheap flights to Hanoi, Vietnam and packed her backpack for a 10-day solo trip. Grace has so much insight and experience to share; I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to interview her, even if she’s not *exactly* college-aged.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you choose to travel to Hanoi, Vietnam?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: I usually go on vacation in October because it aligns with my work schedule, and flights tend to be cheaper during that off-season. I use Google Flights to explore options from both SeaTac and Vancouver airports, choosing the most cost-effective option. Last year, I found a $450 round-trip flight from Seattle to Hanoi, which seemed like a great deal. I was considering various destinations, including Colombia, but the affordable flight to Hanoi made it an irresistible opportunity.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you plan and prepare for your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: My research involved checking TikTok for travel insights. I’d be traveling solo, so I searched for social hostels. I opted for a hostel with organized excursions, simplifying my travel plans. I did minimal research, as I wanted to keep my plans open and flexible.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Can you share details about your excursions?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: I participated in a Halong Bay overnight boat tour, which was a scenic experience with around 50 people from the hostel. I also went on a three-day motorcycle tour in the mountains. The hostel served as my base, allowing me to leave my backpack during excursions and return to a familiar environment. The excursions ranged from $150 to $250.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What was your favorite moment during the trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: One memorable moment was during the motorcycle tour when it started pouring rain as we drove through mountainous areas. Despite the stress, once we reached the town for the night, everyone was relieved and shared laughter over a good dinner.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Why did you choose to travel alone, and how was your experience as a solo traveler?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: I prefer solo travel because it allows me to prioritize my preferences without the need for compromises. Traveling alone provides a sense of freedom, and I find it easier to meet new people and hear their stories.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you pack?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: I packed based on the expected weather, ensuring I had versatile clothing. Being vegetarian, I checked the food options in advance. I always carry a backup puffer jacket and a sleeping bag liner for hostels. I traveled with a backpack as my carry-on.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What do you wish you had known before your trip to Vietnam?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: I wish I had done more research on Vietnam's history and culture. Due to the last-minute nature of the trip, I didn't have much time to delve into the background, and having more knowledge beforehand would have enhanced my appreciation of the country.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What was the best food you had in Vietnam, and where did you find it?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: The best food I had was a Banh Mi sandwich in Hanoi. Despite being vegetarian, I accidentally had a non-vegetarian sandwich, but it turned out to be delicious.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Why is Hanoi a good destination for college students?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: Hanoi offers a perfect combination of beauty, safety, and affordability. The city has a vibrant atmosphere, delicious food and established backpacking trails. It's a place where college students can explore and meet people from different countries.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What safety precautions did you take as a solo traveler in Vietnam?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: I downloaded the Life360 app to share my location with friends and family. I stayed in hostels, preferably in female-only rooms, and took basic precautions such as being aware of my surroundings and avoiding isolated areas at night.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Would you go back to Vietnam, and if so, why?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: Definitely. Vietnam has everything I look for in a trip—affordability, beauty, great food and friendly people. I would love to explore more of the country and spend more time there.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What advice do you have for college-age or younger travelers?</p>

  

  
    
<p>GRACE: Just go for it. Don't let the fear of traveling alone hold you back. The initial learning curve is worth the adventure, and solo travel allows you to fully embrace your preferences without compromises.</p>

  

  
    
<h2>Recommendations</h2>

  

  
    
<h3>Public transportation</h3>

  

  
    
<ul>
  
  <li>You can use buses, trains, taxis, motorbike taxis, cyclos (pedicabs) and xe om (motorbike taxis) to get around Vietnam. Buses are cheap and frequent, but they can be crowded and slow. Trains are comfortable and scenic, but not very fast. Taxis are convenient and affordable, but make sure to use a reputable company and agree on the fare before you get in. Motorbike taxis and cyclos are fun and adventurous, but not very safe or regulated. Xe om are similar to motorbike taxis, but you can also rent them for a day or longer.</li>
