        <h1>Explore Egypt</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Drew Silberman completed his first round of army service for Israel’s Defense Forces in May 2023, at age 21. Post-army, he and his friends traveled to many destinations around the world, including Egypt, Portugal and Morocco. Egypt was Drew’s favorite, so we chatted about his unique experiences. After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Drew was called back from the army reserves and re-joined a unit in Israel.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  How did you pack for your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  Driving across the border in Eilat, Israel instead of flying spared me from worrying about bag fees. I packed my huge hiking backpack with mostly beach clothes and some snacks, ensuring a hassle-free journey.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Why did you choose Sinai for your trip, and what factors influenced that decision?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  Sinai was an obvious choice because it's both cheap and easy to get to, offering a lot of attractions. The decision was influenced by its affordability, accessibility and the variety of experiences it had to offer.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Can you walk us through the beginning of your journey?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  We left early on a Sunday morning, took a train to Be’er Sheva and then took a bus to Eilat. After crossing the border, we grabbed a cab to Dahab. The first night led us to a bar on the water, and we met Omar and Mustafa, two Egyptian guys our age. We ended up hanging out with them until around 3a.m.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Share an unforgettable moment.</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  After hiking to the top of Mt. Sinai, we were with a group of about 15 travelers from different countries. With no cell service, we had two hours before sunrise, during which our unlikely group of friends shared food, told jokes and created lasting memories.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  If you could change something about the trip, what would it be?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  I wish I had known more Arabic phrases. We expected people to speak Hebrew or English, but that wasn't always the case.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Where would you recommend that college-aged people stay?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  I’d recommend Dahab over Sharm El Sheikh, which is the main city in Sinai, simply because of the difference in the prices.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Were there any challenges you faced regarding scams or dealing with locals, and how did you handle it?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  It's crucial to be assertive and watch out for scammers in Egypt, like people who will way overcharge you or flat out sell a fake product. Making local friends was invaluable in navigating these situations. Were there any specific scams to be aware of there?</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  What were the best and worst parts of your trip, and why?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -   One of the best parts was going to the show/party in the desert on our last night. It was completely spontaneous, and I liked that we were the only foreign tourists there because we knew we were in a genuinely Egyptian place and not just some tourist trap. The worst part was watching my friend wipe out on a motorbike, but thankfully, he only had some road rash.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Who did you travel with, and how did your group dynamic contribute to the overall experience?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  I traveled with my roommates, whom I'd been living with for almost a year. Our close bond and lack of stress about arguments made for a solid group dynamic.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Why should college-aged people travel to Egypt?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  Visiting Egypt provides a unique experience due to its dramatically different culture compared to other popular destinations, making it valuable for college students.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Would you go back to Egypt?</p>

  

  
    
<p>DREW -  100%. Not only is there a ton to do, but the cheap prices make it possible to do a lot of different experiences without stressing about how much money you're spending.</p>

<h3>Public transportation</h3>

  

  
    
<ul>
  
  <li>You can use buses, trains, taxis, microbuses, metro and feluccas (traditional sailboats) to get around Egypt. Buses are cheap and reliable, but not very comfortable or safe. Trains are more comfortable and faster, but more expensive and less frequent. Taxis are easy to find and negotiate, but be aware of scams and traffic jams. Microbuses are small vans that run on fixed routes and fares, but they are often overcrowded and reckless. Metro is a subway system that operates in Cairo, and it is fast, cheap and clean. Feluccas are a great way to enjoy the Nile River, but they are not suitable for long distances.</li>
