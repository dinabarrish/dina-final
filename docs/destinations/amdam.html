        <h1>Explore Amsterdam</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Leni Steinhardt is a senior journalism major at the University of Texas, just like me. She even studied abroad in Madrid at the same time I did. I chatted with Leni about her weekend trip to Amsterdam this past March. She shared great highlights and must-dos in the city.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you pack for your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>LENI: To be completely honest, after weeks of traveling around Europe I got into the terrible habit of leaving my backpack (which was my suitcase for the whole semester) at the base of my bed for the entire week. I knew it was going to be cold so I made sure to pack my warmest jacket and think pants. I still managed to forget my mittens!</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you choose to go to Amsterdam?</p>

  

  
    
<p>LENI: I had been before when I was 13, during the summer. I wanted to experience Amsterdam in the cold and as an adult – or closer to an adult. To this day it’s still one of my favorite cities and one of the only ones from past travels that I wanted to go back to!</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Walk me through your trip itinerary.</p>

  

  
    
<p>LENI: Laine, my friend from Texas, came and visited me in Amsterdam. It was one of my first times flying solo abroad but we made sure to coordinate that her flight from New York and mine from Madrid landed at the same time. I waited for my friend Laine in baggage claim and once she arrived we immediately headed to the hotel!</p>

  

  
    
<p>After dropping our bags off we were starving so we headed to get pancakes- famous in Amsterdam. We had a glorious breakfast at Pancake Amsterdam and then immediately went shopping to find my mittens because it had begun snowing! After some shopping we took a canal ride with “Those Dam Boat Guys.” We’d reserved it in advance. Even with the thin visibility with all the snow it was still magical to see Amsterdam by boat! After the boat we headed to the Tulip Museum where we learned about the Netherlands flower!</p>

  

  
    
<p>Our second day was jam packed with a visit to the bench from the movie “The Fault in Our Stars”. After seeing the bench we spent time at Anne Frank House. I had been when I was 13 but I refused to go to Amsterdam without seeing it again. It’s an impactful and emotional walk through the museum, but an important one. After the house we explored one of the many flower markets along the canals. When we got hungry we made sure to get some stroopwaffles even if it meant standing in a line for an hour. I still dream of the Stroop waffles. After the waffles we went to the Heineken Storehouse – one of the highlights of Amsterdam for sure. Even though I don’t drink a lot of beer it was really interesting to learn about the history of Heineken!</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What was a moment on your trip that made you laugh?</p>

  

  
    
<p>LENI: When my friend and I went to The Fault in Our Stars bench. We’re both huge fans of the movie, and the entire time we couldn’t stop quoting “okay? Okay.”</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What do you wish you would have known going into your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>LENI: I wish I would have known when tulip season is! I possibly would have delayed my trip if I knew that the tulip season began just three weeks after I visited. I guess this means I have to go back to experience Amsterdam in the spring.</p>

  

  
    
<h2>Recommendations</h2>

  

  
    
<h3>Public transportation</h3>

  

  
    
<ul>
  
  <li>You can use trams, buses, metro, trains, bikes, taxis, boats and walking to get around Amsterdam. Trams are the most popular and convenient way to travel within the city center, but they can be crowded and slow during peak hours. Buses are useful for reaching the outskirts of the city or nearby towns, but they are also subject to traffic delays. Metro is a subway system that connects the city center with the suburbs, but it is not very extensive or frequent. Trains are the best way to travel between Amsterdam and other cities in the Netherlands or Europe, but they can be expensive if you don’t book in advance. Bikes are the most common and fun way to explore Amsterdam like a local, but you need to be careful of traffic rules and bike thefts. Taxis are easy to find and hail, but they are very expensive and not very eco-friendly. Boats are a great way to enjoy the canals and see the city from a different perspective.</li>
