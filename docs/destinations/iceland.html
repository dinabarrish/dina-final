        <h1>Explore Reykjavík</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Below is a piece I wrote for United’s Employee Travel Blog during my internship, chronicling my last-minute trip to Reykjavík, Iceland.</p>

  

  
    
<p>It’s 8:54 p.m. as we sprint through the ORD underpass, rainbow lights and Rhapsody in Blue mocking us as the seconds tick away until the gate closure. Breathless, we arrive at Gate C15 — only to see the customer service representatives shutting the jetway door and disappointed standby travelers calculating plan B.</p>

  

  
    
<p>And then? A miracle. The pilot releases the weight restriction that was originally placed on the flight, opening seats for me and fellow Corporate Communications Intern Sneha Mohan to Reykjavík, Iceland. Ecstatic doesn’t even begin to describe the feeling.</p>

  

  
    
<p>From there, Sneha and I jumped headfirst into adventure mode. We spent the flight researching excursions, must-sees and Airbnbs, so that when we landed, all it took was two hours sitting in baggage claim to nail down a weekend itinerary.</p>

  

  
    
<p>First, we headed on a walking tour. As we admired Reykjavík’s Rainbow Street and mountain backdrop, we learned, among other interesting facts about Icelandic culture, that you’re legally obligated to name your child from a list of about 1,000 approved names. I loved seeing the colorful city, and our guide gave helpful suggestions on where to eat and what more to experience.</p>

  

  
    
<p>During the Central Time workday, we settled into a local coffee shop. Later than night, we enjoyed Icelandic soup and ice cream. Of course, 11:30 p.m. looks like broad daylight, which was surreal for me. Between my adrenaline and the ever-present sun, Iceland in the summer meant nonstop excitement.</p>

  

  
    
<p>The next morning kicked off my favorite part of the trip: the Golden Circle tour. We walked along the edges of a beautiful crater, hiked above a geyser and watched it erupt, stood between the tectonic plates of North America and Eurasia, explored a canyon filled with glacier water and marveled at the Golden Waterfall. At two separate stops, we almost missed the bus because we were so captivated by the nature around us.</p>

  

  
    
<p>Iceland made the world feel both vast and small — vast because there are so many natural wonders, and small because all we had to do to get there was hop on a six hour flight.</p>

  

  
    
<p>In the evening, we strolled along the coast and watched the pink sunset. Bonus content for us: at Reykjavík’s tallest lookout point, we coincidentally met Phil Rosenthal from the Netflix food series, “Somebody Feed Phil!” If this sounds like a perfect day: it was.</p>

  

  
    
<p>We spent our last afternoon relaxing in the Blue Lagoon. Even with the sharp winds around us, the naturally heated, peaceful water kept us comfortable. I already want to go back, so don’t be surprised to see my name on the standby list.</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>

  

  
    
<ul>
  
  <li>Reykjavik is one of the safest cities in the world, but it is also a remote and expensive destination. You should be prepared for any emergencies and plan your budget accordingly. Be aware of the weather conditions and dress appropriately. Iceland can be very cold and windy, especially in winter.</li>
  
</ul>
