        <h1>Explore Costa Rica</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Sneha Mohan is a junior computer science Major at the University of Illinois. She interned with me at United Airlines this past summer. Costa Rica had been on Sneha’s “trip wish list” since the beginning of our internship, and I was so excited to speak with her about when she finally had the opportunity to travel there.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: How did you choose to go to Costa Rica?</p>

  

  
    
<p>SNEHA: Actually, I had been wanting to go to Costa Rica for a while. I’d traveled to Europe several times during the summer with friends, and I felt like it was time for a change. South America offered a different cultural experience, and since I had learned Spanish in high school, it seemed like the perfect opportunity. Plus, Costa Rica is known for ecotourism, which I’m really interested in.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Walk me through your trip, from start to finish.</p>

  

  
    
<p>SNEHA: Sure! We landed in Costa Rica on a Friday night after a series of layovers. We found a bunch of cost-efficient hostel options, and we booked beds at one of them. After landing, we went to a nearby casino. The next morning, we embarked on a full-day excursion. We initially planned to use a GetYourGuide tour, but by the time we went to buy tickets, the tour had sold out. We ended up renting a car and following a similar itinerary. We visited a coffee plantation, a waterfall and La Fortuna (which had a volcano). We also did lots of activities like hiking and birdwatching. We saw incredible wildlife, including snakes and sloths. The day ended with a visit to hot springs and a traditional Costa Rican dinner.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What was a moment on the trip that made you laugh?</p>

  

  
    
<p>SNEHA: The entire drive back from the mountains in complete darkness was an unexpected adventure, and we were a bit lost. We were screaming because there were wild animals around. It was surreal, and we couldn't help but laugh at our situation.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What's something you wish you would have known before the trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>SNEHA: I wish I had known that renting a car would be more challenging than expected. In hindsight, booking through a service like GetYourGuide might have provided more flexibility and safety, especially considering the nighttime mountain drive.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What was the best food you ate during the trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>SNEHA: Definitely the dinner we had in La Fortuna. They had excellent Costa Rican dishes, such as Casado (a variety of vegetables with eggs and rice, beautifully plated). Even as a vegetarian, I found plenty of delicious options.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: What's your advice to future college-aged travelers going to Costa Rica?</p>

  

  
    
<p>SNEHA: Be ready to rally! There's a lot to see and do, so just embrace the adventure. Also, consider using platforms like TikTok to find recommendations and plan your itinerary. It's a great tool for trip planning that helped me a lot.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS: Would you go back?</p>

  

  
    
<p>SNEHA: Absolutely, I'd love to go back. The trip was amazing, and there's still so much more to explore in Costa Rica.</p>

  

  
    
<h2>Recommendations</h2>

  

  
    
<h3>Public transportation</h3>

  

  
    
<ul>
  
  <li>You can use buses, shuttles, taxis, rental cars, domestic flights and ferries to get around Costa Rica. Buses are the most common and cheapest way to travel, but they can be slow, crowded and confusing. Shuttles are mini-buses that offer more comfort and convenience, but they are more expensive and require advance booking. Taxis are widely available and metered, but they can be expensive and unreliable in some areas. Rental cars are a good option for exploring the country at your own pace, but they can be costly and challenging to drive on some roads. Domestic flights are the fastest and easiest way to travel long distances, but they are also the most expensive and have strict luggage limits. Ferries are a scenic way to cross the Gulf of Nicoya or Lake Arenal.</li>
