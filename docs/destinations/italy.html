        <h1>Explore Cinque Terre</h1>
        

  
    
<p>Maddie Harris is a senior neuroscience major at College of William and Mary. While I was abroad in Madrid, Maddie studied in Florence, Italy. I spoke with Maddie about her two-day adventure in Cinque Terre with a few of her roommates abroad. She has lots to share about activities and food in the beautiful city.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  How did you pack for your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  I brought a backpack with a swimsuit, a change of clothes for the next day, pajamas and my toiletries.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  How did you choose to go to Cinque Terre?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  I had heard so many great things about it, and I loved the movie Luca, which was based on this region!</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  What was the itinerary of your day trip from Florence to Cinque Terre?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  We departed Florence with our study abroad program, taking a bus at 6:45 am and reaching La Spezia around 9 am. We then boarded a ferry to Porto Venere, explored the area and later took another ferry to Vernazza for shopping and relaxation by the water. We then traveled to Monterosso, had a late lunch and returned to La Spezia by ferry. We ended the night playing games and chatting.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  What excursions did you do in Cinque Terre?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  We took a train from La Spezia to Corniglia, grabbing breakfast before purchasing hiking trail tickets. Initially, we had trouble finding the hike entrance in Corniglia. Once we found it, we went on a challenging hike through narrow cliff paths and steep sections, ending up in Monterosso. Our non-hiking friends waited for us at the beach, where we enjoyed the ocean, met a girl from Germany and had lunch. Following a gelato stop, we took a train back to La Spezia and then to Florence.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  What was a moment on your trip that made you laugh?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  Seeing our sweat stains on our butts when we put down our backpacks in the middle of the hike.</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  What do you wish you would have known going into your trip?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  I didn’t realize how close Cinque Terre was to Genoa (the birthplace of pesto) so I wish I got more pesto pasta! The seafood there was also great, I’ve heard (but I’m a vegetarian, so I didn’t try any).</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Where did you stay?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  I stayed in an airbnb in La Spezia, Italy (not technically part of Cinque Terre but very close to it and accessible to travel to Cinque Terre by train/bus!)</p>

  

  
    
<p>POSTCARDS -  Why is this a good place for college students to travel?</p>

  

  
    
<p>MADDIE -  Gets you active with pretty views! While there were older people doing the hike too, I think it’s probably easier to do when you’re younger! Also to just do the hike and go to the beach was pretty inexpensive (the pass for the hike was just 7.50 euros with our European visa as students there for the semester, but it might be 18.20 euros without one), the food was also pretty well priced, and of course window shopping (my favorite past time) is free if you don’t buy anything. So there was a lot to do for free/cheap! There also were a lot of people of all ages there, from young kids, to college students to older adults.</p>

  

  
    
<h2>Recommendations</h2>

  

  
    
<h3>Public transportation</h3>

  

  
    
<ul>
  
  <li>You can use the train, boat or hiking to explore the five villages. The train is the fastest and most convenient way to travel between them and runs frequently along the coast. You can buy a single ticket or a Cinque Terre Card, which includes unlimited train rides and access to hiking trails and museums. The boat service is seasonal and scenic, but more expensive and dependent on weather conditions. The hiking trails are challenging but rewarding, offering stunning views of the sea and the villages.<a href="https://www.introducingmadrid.com/transport"> </a></li>
